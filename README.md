## Testing Code Tutorial Worksheet 2: Couch Pouch - A Complex Business Problem

The "Couch Pouch" project is your team’s first step in assessing how blockchain technology could help update traditional financial systems and create a digital ‘wallet’ platform, specifically in the recording and management of financial transactions. 

At its core, the project aims to help the individuals gain a deeper, more technical understanding of blockchain's potential benefits, including enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency.  Essentially, it is useful to think of a blockchain wallet like a digital keychain - in the real world, a keychain helps secure things you own, like your house or car. In the digital world of cryptocurrency, a blockchain wallet serves a similar purpose but for your digital money.

This investigation should help evaluate the practical, security, and performance of deploying blockchain for core financial transaction management and explore how this technology could improve traditional models by offering unparalleled transparency and security.  

Blockchain operates as a distributed ledger, recording transactions to help ensure a secure, transparent, and unalterable record. This structure not only minimises fraud and reduce possible transaction times but also provides a transparent and permanent transaction log.

Although the overall project should provide significant advancements and a potential need (later) to review challenges and obstacles such as blockchain scalability, regulatory adherence, privacy issues, and the upfront costs.  Your ‘current’ role (as software engineers) will be dedicated to the ensuring the quality of design and development, focusing solely on ensuring a robust codebase.


Your role is critical: review and test the initial codebase to ensure it meets the organisation’s requirements for financial transaction recording and management. You will assess the feasibility of incorporating blockchain into the financial product’s development by providing essential feedback on quality assurance, adoption viability, and areas needing further development, exploration and/or testing.

To setup your project, use the previous worksheet to initialise your project together the project’s initial source code.



### A 15 Min Review Presentation 
To complete this task, you are expected to briefly outline the purpose of testing before focusing on unit and integration tests supported with an understanding of a TDD or BDD approach to any associated user-based stories.  Your review is expected to be a live presentation (up to a max duration of 15mins). Ideally, demonstrating a walk-through of the project, test planning, test scripts and your test results; see the details below for an overall breakdown of the requirements; the presentation should include evidence of your actual project with explained and highlighted tests scripts, live testing and evaluated results (i.e., show and tell).
